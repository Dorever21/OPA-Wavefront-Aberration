# OPA-Wavefront-Aberration
Matlab simulation program used to investigate wavefront degeneration in the OPA process of a large aperture ultrashort OPCPA system. This research can help laser expert to understand reasons of wavefront degeneration in these systems and give some advices to build an optimizated system.
